<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>1. I am working toward Getting a job as soon as possible. Some things that have led me this far already would have to be my parents helping me out with anything that i need and i can become closer to my goals.

2. Some ways i'm working toward these goals are that i try to stay on a schedule whenever I am doing something throughout my day. A daily routine could be setup from morning to night such as waking up at 5:30 every morning getting to school on time and be home on time to finish all my unfinished tasks.

3. Things that i value the most necessary for success would be my family and how everyone supports each other in what we each do.

4. I hope to get to get my drivers license as soon as i turn 16 and i also hope to finally buy my car i have been saving up on.

5. Some character traits and achievements i would like to be known for would be that I am a person who doesn't give up and doesn't stop working hard even when i am in the worst times
